# Security

## Certificates:
  - Encryption:
      - Symetric vs Asymetric
          - Symetric: same key for encryption and decryption
          - Asymmetric: different keys for encryption and decryption

### Certificates 
  Are digital documents
  - used to verify the identity of entities, such as servers. 
  - contain information such as the `entity's public key`, 
  - contain `metadata`: organization details, validity period, owner
  - contain a digital signature from a Certificate Authority (CA) to ensure authenticity - or self signed.
         
### Keys
  1. Public key 
     - used to `encrypt` data
     - is `shared` with others
     - is used to verify the signature

  2. Private key: 
     - used to `decrypt` data
     - is kept `secret`
     - is used to sign the data
     - it is generated by the entity that owns the certificate

### Signature
  - used for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents.
  - created using the private key
  - verified using the public key

### Algorithms: RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA

  - openssl, keytool
  - SSL/TLS - Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
  - SSH - Secure Shell
  - HTTPS - HTTP Secure
  - PKI - Public Key Infrastructure
  - CA - Certificate Authority
  - Public/Private keys

## Web vulnerabilities (OWASP)

Types:
- SQL Injection
- XSS - Cross Site Scripting
- CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
- DoS - Denial of Service
- DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service
- RCE - Remote Code Execution
- SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery
- Insecure Deserialization
- RegEx DoS

## OAuth 2.0

### (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

Here's a simplified flow:

- The client (could be a web app) requests authorization from the user.
- The user authorizes the client and gets an **authorization grant**.
- The client presents the **authorization grant** to the authorization server and gets an **access token** (JWT).
- The client can now access the resource server (API) using the **access token**.

OAuth 2.0 is commonly used in scenarios where you see "**Login with Google**" or "**Login with Facebook**".
The advantage is that the user doesn't have to share their password with the third-party app, and they can control what information the third-party app can access.

### OAuth2 types

- **Authorization Code Grant**
- Implicit Grant
- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
- Client Credentials Grant
- Refresh Token Grant
- Device Code Grant
- **JWT Bearer** Token Grant
- SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Grant
- Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants
- Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens
