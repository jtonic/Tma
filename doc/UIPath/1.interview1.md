# Interview 1

## Basics

### OOP

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

### FP

- Pure functions
- Immutability
- Higher order functions
- Referential transparency
- Recursion
- Composition

### Data structures

- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Tuples
- Ranges
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs

### Control structures

- If-else
- Switch
- Loops
  - For
  - While
  - Do-while
  - For-each
- Exception handling

### SOLID principles

- Single responsibility - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change
- Open-closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov substitution - Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality
- Interface segregation - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use
- Dependency inversion - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions

### Design patterns

- Creational patterns
  - Singleton
  - Method Factory
  - Abstract factory
  - Builder

- Structural patterns
  - Adapter (Decorator)
  - Proxy
  - Facade
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Flyweight

- Behavioral patterns
  - Template method
  - Mediator
  - Observer
  - Strategy
  - Command
  - Visitor
  - Chain of responsibility
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Memento
  - State

### Database

- ACID            - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- Normalization   - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
- Transactions    - Begin, Commit, Rollback

### Transaction isolation

- Read Uncommitted: The lowest level, where transactions may read data that has been modified by other transactions but not yet committed.
- Read Committed: Ensures that a transaction can only read data that has been committed.
- Repeatable Read: Ensures that if a transaction reads data it can read that same data again, and it will not have changed by other transactions
- Serializable: The highest level, where transactions are completely isolated from one another.

### NOSQL

- CAP theorem - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
- BASE - Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
- Sharding
- Replication
- Consistency
- Partitioning
- Availability
- Types:
  - Key-value: Redis, Memcached
  - Document: MongoDB
  - Column-family: Cassandra
  - Graph: Neo4j

### Testing

- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Functional testing
- Regression testing
- Performance testing (Load, Stress) - JMeter, Gatling
- System testing
- Acceptance testing
- Security testing
- UI testing - Selenium
- TDD - Test Driven Development

### RESTful services

Principles of REST:
- addressability - URI
- Restricted interface - HTTP methods
- content negotiation - Accept, Content-Type
- HATEOAS - Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State

### Resilience patterns

- Circuit breaker
- Retry
- Timeout
- Throttling
- Backpressure
- Bulkhead
- Isolation of failures
- Fallback
- Rate limiting
- Load shedding
- Fail fast
- Disaster recovery

### Reactive manifesto

- Responsive - React to users in a timely manner
- Resilient - React to failures
- Elastic - React to load
- Message driven - React to events

### Kafka concepts

- Topics
- Cluster
- Partitions
- Producers
- Consumers
- Consumer groups
- Delivery guarantee
  - At most once
  - At least once
  - Exactly once
- Offsets
- Replication
- Retention
- Compaction
- Log compaction
- Log retention
- Log segment

## Architecture
- Microservices
  - Service discovery (Service Registry): Spring Cloud Eureka
  - Load balancing: Spring Cloud Ribbon
  - Circuit breaker: Spring Cloud Hystrix
  - API gateway: Spring Cloud Zuul
  - Resilient: Spring Retry
  - CQRS - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  - Event sourcing - Store events instead of state
  - Saga pattern - Long-running transactions
  - Domain-driven design
    - Entities
    - Domain events
    - Bounded context
    - Aggregates
    - Value objects
- Event-driven
- Modular monolith - Split monolith into modules
- Monolithic
- Layered (N-tier)
- Hexagonal
  - Ports and adapters
  - Onion
- FP in small and OOP in large
  - Functional core, side effects shell (and of the world)
  - Immutable data
  - Pure functions - No side effects
  - Referential transparency
  - Composition
  - Higher order functions
- SOA - Service-oriented architecture - Services communicate with each other - SOAP, REST
- Serverless - AWS Lambda, Azure Functions (Java ZGC)
