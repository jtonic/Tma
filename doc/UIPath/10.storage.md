## Database

- ACID            - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- Normalization   - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF
- Transactions    - Begin, Commit, Rollback

## Transaction isolation

- Read Uncommitted: The lowest level, where transactions may read data that has been modified by other transactions but not yet committed.
- Read Committed: Ensures that a transaction can only read data that has been committed.
- Repeatable Read: Ensures that if a transaction reads data it can read that same data again, and it will not have changed by other transactions
- Serializable: The highest level, where transactions are completely isolated from one another.

## NOSQL

- CAP theorem - Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance
- BASE - Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent
- Sharding
- Replication
- Consistency
- Partitioning
- Availability
- Types:
    - Key-value: Redis, Memcached
