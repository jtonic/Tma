### RESTful services

Principles of REST:

- addressability - URI
- Restricted interface - HTTP methods
- content negotiation - Accept, Content-Type
- HATEOAS - Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State

- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD)

- Response status codes
    - 1xx - Informational
    - 2xx - Success (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content, 202 Accepted)
    - 3xx - Redirection
    - 4xx - Client error (400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, 409 Conflict, 429 Too Many Requests)
    - 5xx - Server error (500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout)

- Headers
    - Accept, Content-Type - content negotiation
    - Authorization - Basic, Bearer, Digest
    - Caching: Cache-Control, Expires, Last-Modified
    - Host

### Resilience patterns

  - Circuit breaker
  - Retry
  - Timeout
  - Throttling
  - Backpressure
  - Bulkhead
  - Isolation of failures
  - Fallback
  - Rate limiting
  - Load shedding
  - Fail fast
  - Disaster recovery

### Reactive manifesto

  - Responsive - React to users in a timely manner
  - Resilient - React to failures
  - Elastic - React to load
  - Message driven - React to events
