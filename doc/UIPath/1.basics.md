## SOLID principles

- Single responsibility - A class should have one, and only one, reason to change
- Open-closed - Open for extension, closed for modification
- Liskov substitution - Objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the functionality

- Dependency inversion - Depend on abstractions, not on concretions
