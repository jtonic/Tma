# Security

## Certificates:
    - Encryption:
        - Symetric vs Asymetric
            - Symetric: same key for encryption and decryption
            - Asymmetric: different keys for encryption and decryption
    - Signature
    - Algorithms: RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA
    - openssl, keytool
    - SSL/TLS - Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
    - SSH - Secure Shell
    - HTTPS - HTTP Secure
    - PKI - Public Key Infrastructure
    - CA - Certificate Authority
    - Public/Private keys

## Web vulnerabilities (OWASP)

Types:
- SQL Injection
- XSS - Cross Site Scripting
- CSRF - Cross Site Request Forgery
- DoS - Denial of Service
- DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service
- RCE - Remote Code Execution
- SSRF - Server Side Request Forgery
- Insecure Deserialization
- RegEx DoS

## OAuth 2.0

### (Open Authorization) is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows third-party services to exchange your information without you having to give away your password.

Here's a simplified flow:

- The client (could be a web app) requests authorization from the user.
- The user authorizes the client and gets an **authorization grant**.
- The client presents the **authorization grant** to the authorization server and gets an **access token** (JWT).
- The client can now access the resource server (API) using the **access token**.

OAuth 2.0 is commonly used in scenarios where you see "**Login with Google**" or "**Login with Facebook**".
The advantage is that the user doesn't have to share their password with the third-party app, and they can control what information the third-party app can access.

### OAuth2 types

- **Authorization Code Grant**
- Implicit Grant
- Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant
- Client Credentials Grant
- Refresh Token Grant
- Device Code Grant
- **JWT Bearer** Token Grant
- SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Grant
- Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants
- Mutual TLS Client Authentication and Certificate-Bound Access Tokens
